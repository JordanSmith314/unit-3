<h1>tasks and salary</h1>
<p>	Architects do not just design and maintain buildings. They have many other duties. The have to work well with customer service. Architects work very closely with their clients. They constantly meet and discuss design, location, budget, and any other specifications. Architects must have very good written and oral communication skills as well as organization and creativity skills. Designing the buildings is not just about the building itself. Architects have to consider environmental impact, cost, and usage of land. Architects consider all of these aspects and produce a step by step guide for the builders to follow. This step by step guide will include how the plumbing, heating, ventilation, electricity and other important actors will play out. Although architects would love to go crazy with their buildings, they have to follow laws like fire regulation, disability access, and city regulations. Most of the time architects also have to create with the latest building styles and energy efficient products.
</p>
